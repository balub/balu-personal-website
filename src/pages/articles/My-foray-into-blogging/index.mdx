I have always liked wanted to dive into the world of blogging, I have always wanted to develop writing as a habit. I have a deep appreciation for well-crafted literature and aspire to reach a level where I can create such pieces myself one day.

Over the years, many people I've met have urged me to document my various projects â€” from detailing the setup of my homelab to my passion for building mechanical keyboards, sharing my experiences with 3D printers, and chronicling the diverse projects I've undertaken like my journey of learning Vim and much more.

I've always sought a platform where I can write about all my engineering and non-engineering endeavours, as well as anything else cool that catches my eye.

Stay tuned, and let's have some fun! ðŸš€
